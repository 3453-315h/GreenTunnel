GreenTunnel bypasses DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) systems found in many ISPs (Internet Service Providers) which block access to certain websites.

## FAQ
> **How does it work?**
###### DNS
When you enter a URL in a Web browser, the first thing the Web browser does is to ask a DNS (Domain Name System) server, at a known numeric address, to look up the domain name referenced in the URL and supply the corresponding IP address.
If the DNS server is configured to block access, it consults a blacklist of banned domain names. When a browser requests the IP address for one of these domain names, the DNS server gives a wrong answer or no answer at all.
GreenTunnel use [DNS over HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS "doh (DNS over HTTPS)") and [DNS over TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS "DNS over TLS") to get real IP address and bypass DNS Spoofing.

###### HTTP
There are gaps in providers in DPI.  They happen from what the DPI rules write for ordinary user programs, omitting all possible cases that are permissible by standards.  This is done for simplicity and speed.
Some DPIs cannot recognize the HTTP request if it is divided into TCP segments.  For example, a request of the form

```
GET / HTTP/1.0`
Host: www.youtube.com
...
```
we send it in 2 parts: first comes `GET / HTTP/1.0 \n Host: www.you` and second sends as `tube.com \n ...`. In this example, ISP cannot find blocked word **youtube** in packets and you can bypass it!

###### HTTPS
Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to TLS (Transport Layer Security) that indicates the actual destination hostname a client is attempting to access over HTTPS. For this Web Filter feature, SNI hostname information is used for blocking access to specific sites over HTTPS. For example, if the administrator chooses to block the hostname **youtube** using this feature, all Website access attempts over HTTPS that contain **youtube** like **www.youtube.com** in the SNI would be blocked. However, access to the same hostname over HTTP would not be blocked by this feature. GreenTunnel tries to split first **CLIENT-HELLO** packet into small chunks and ISPs can't parse packet and found SNI field so bypass traffic!


## Development notes
GreenTunnel is an open-source app and I really appreciate other developers adding new features and/or helping fix bugs. If you want to contribute to GreenTunnel, you can fork this repository, make the changes and create a pull request.
